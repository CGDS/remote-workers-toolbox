# Tools available for remote workers

Remote work is hard, no matter what the self help books and coworking space marketers say. Office workers have certain benefits: regular interaction with coworkers, a stable location with good wifi and amenities, the ability to improve their cubicles, and above all, routine. Remote workers often don't have these things, and the grind of finding them is real. 

I've been debating a lot about remote work recently, especially during times of burn out or frustration. During these times, it is good to remember that jQuery, or Sketch, or my writer newsletters aren't the only things that are in my toolbox. 

This list is for those times - these are tools that can be used to refocus, to become present, to fight loneliness, depression, and choke points for productivity. _Please contribute if you have tools you use that are not on this list._ 

These are all also useful for office workers - however, I feel that remote workers, digital nomads, and specifically tech workers often need to be reminded they exist, and to use them. 

## Immediate Tools
 
 * **Go for a walk**.
 * **Ask for help**. Ask anyone working near you, or on social media.
 * **Write your problem down**. Often, the simple act of writing helps clarify complex problems. 
 * **Wash your face with cold water**. (Chemical effects)?
 * **Take a shower**.
 * **Go for a run**. 
 * **Eat something sweet**, like chocolate. There are immediate benefits for energy levels (cite).

## Daily Tools

 * **Exercise**.
 * **Diet**. Some diets may be particularly helpful, such as the [keto]() diet. 
 * **Avoid your phone when waking up for as long as possible**. This will help you avoid the downward spiral of reacting to everything.
 * **Write down your daily tasks the night before**. This can also be done at the end of your workday.
 * **Select 1 thing to do each day**. No more - get one thing done.
 * **Party moderately**. It is very easy to party too hard on the road. Remember this is your life. 
 * **Journal daily**. 

## Long Term Tools

 * **Keep in touch with friends at home**. Write letters, skype, facebook poke. Do whatever you can to keep mundane relationships going.
 * **Foster community where you are**. For instance, throw a [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io), join #Nomads, go to CouchSurfing meetups.
 * **Give back to your communities where you are**. This will help you feel connected and fight loneliness.
